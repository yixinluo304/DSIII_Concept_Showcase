This project analyzes customer feedback through **aspect-based sentiment analysis** and **n-gram analysis**, providing actionable insights into guest experiences. Key aspects like **location**, **service**, **room**, and **staff** were evaluated to identify strengths, weaknesses, and trends in reviews.

### **Key Methods**

-   **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: Using **Hugging Face's DistilBERT**, I classified sentiments for each aspect, supported by **multithreading** for scalability.
-   **Term Frequency and N-gram Analysis**: Common words, bigrams, and trigrams were identified, normalized, and visualized to uncover recurring themes and guest priorities.

### **Why This Matters**

By combining sentiment and linguistic analyses, this approach enables businesses to: - Understand guest preferences and concerns. - Improve service quality with data-driven insights. - Uncover patterns in customer feedback to enhance guest satisfaction.
